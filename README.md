# 🧠 SnapSale : Smart Price Comparator Platform

Welcome to the **SnapSale Price Comparator Project**, a full-scale Business Intelligence and Machine Learning platform that helps users make optimized decisions across **flight & hotel reservations** and **supermarket product purchases**.

This repository documents our end-to-end system that integrates data analytics, AI/ML models, and interactive dashboards tailored to **customers** and **business owners**. Our goal is to create transparency, personalization, and efficiency in pricing decisions across multiple domains.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Our Price Comparator system operates on three major domains:

1. ✈️ **Flight Reservations**
2. 🏨 **Hotel Bookings**
3. 🛒 **Supermarket Shopping**

We collect and analyze data in these areas to support **two decision-making roles**:
- 🎯 **Normal Customers**
- 🧑‍💼 **Business Owners**

Each role is supported with a customized **Power BI Dashboard** and AI-driven insights for smarter actions.

## 👤 Dashboard for Normal Customers

We’ve created a **personalized dashboard** for users to:

- 🔍 Compare average basket values, price variation by month
- 🏬 Track purchases by store, product, and location
- 📈 Visualize trends (e.g. price spikes in December, airline delay rates)
- ✈️ Get smart travel advice (e.g. avoid high-delay airlines like Nouvelair)
- 💸 Optimize future purchases and bookings with historical insights

Each insight is paired with an **auto-generated report** written in natural language to enhance user understanding.

## 🧑‍💼 Dashboard for Business Owners

Tailored insights for stakeholders, including:

- 🧾 Total revenue, average revenue per reservation, and profit margin analysis
- 🧍 Customer satisfaction metrics (e.g., average ratings)
- 🏪 Product performance by store and profit margin distribution
- 📊 Seasonal demand forecasting for resource planning
- 🧠 AI-powered insights to support pricing strategies and stock optimization

Owners can filter by region, store, or holiday season, and export data as needed.
